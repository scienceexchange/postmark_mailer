# PostmarkMailer

This gem is designed to provide a (nearly) drop-in replacement for Ruby on Rails' `ActionMailer` for those wishing to deliver emails using [Postmark's Templates API](https://postmarkapp.com/why/templates). Its interface mimics that of `ActionMailer` so switching existing mailers should require minimal effort, and usage should be familiar to most Ruby on Rails developers.

_**NOTE:** This gem only provides a means of delivering transactional emails from a Ruby on Rails application with a Postmark template, and does **not** provide any functionality for managing templates. Such functionality is already provided by Postmark's API and their Ruby client._

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'postmark_mailer', github: 'scienceexchange/postmark_mailer'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install postmark_mailer

## Usage

To start sending emails with Postmark's templates, you will need to set up some minimal configuration, and then make some changes to the mailer classes themselves.

### Configuration

In `app/initializers/postmark_mailer.rb`, add the following configuration block:

```ruby
PostmarkMailer.configure do |config|
  config.api_key = YOUR_POSTMARK_API_KEY # required
  config.default_delivery_queue = :mailers # defaults to :default
end
```

### Defining Mailers

To illustrate the usage of `PostmarkMailer`, let's take a look at a typical Rails mailer:

```ruby
class MyCoolMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  def welcome(user)
    @user = user

    mail(
      to: @user.email,
      subject: 'Welcome to Our Product!'
    )
  end
end
```

The same mailer, using this gem would look like this:

```ruby
class MyCoolMailer < PostmarkMailer::Base
  def welcome(user)
    mail(
      to: user.email,
      template_id: 123_456,
      template_model: {
        first_name: user.first_name
      }
    )
  end
end
```

Note the important changes:

* The mailer now inherits from `PostmarkMailer::Base` instead of `ActionMailer::Base`.
* You add `template_id` to your options hash. _(This is required.)_
* You add `template_model` to your options hash, which is an optional hash of whatever data you'd like to render in your template. _(This is optionalâ€“in the unlikely event your template does not render any specific data, you can safely omit this option.)_

The options you pass into the `#mail` method are ultimately passed on to the `#deliver_with_template` method provided by the Postmark API Ruby client, and so you'll want to [refer to their documentation for a list of all the availabale options](https://postmarkapp.com/developer/api/templates-api#email-with-template).

Because Postmark handles the templating and rendering, you no longer need the views for this mailer, so in this example, you could safely remove `app/views/mailers/my_cool_mailer/welcome.html.erb`.

### Delivering Mailers

Just as you would with a standard mailer, simply call:

```ruby
MyCoolMailer.welcome(user).deliver_later
```

or, less optimally:

```ruby
MyCoolMailer.welcome(user).deliver_now
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
